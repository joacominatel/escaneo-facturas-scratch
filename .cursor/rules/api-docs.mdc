# API Documentation - Invoice Scanner App

This API allows managing the upload, processing, validation, and retrieval of scanned invoices using OCR and potentially AI for data extraction.

---

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the application's base URL. For example, if your application is running at `http://localhost:5000`, the endpoints would be accessed like `http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/...`.

---

## Authentication

_(Note: Authentication details are not specified in the provided code snippets. Add relevant information here if authentication/authorization is implemented, e.g., API Keys, JWT Tokens, etc.)_

---

## Endpoints

---

### 1. Upload Invoices for Processing

`POST /api/invoices/ocr`

**Description:**
Uploads one or more invoice files (PDF, JPEG, PNG) for asynchronous processing. The system saves the file, creates an initial `Invoice` record with status `processing`, and queues a background task (Celery - specifically `process_invoice_task`) to perform OCR and AI-based data extraction.

**Important:** This endpoint returns immediately after accepting the files (202 Accepted). The actual processing happens in the background. You should monitor the invoice status via the `GET /api/invoices/<id>` endpoint or listen for WebSocket events.

**Request:**
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Body:**
    - `file`: One or more files attached.

**Allowed File Types:** `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`.

**Response (Success - 202 Accepted):**
Returns a list of results, one for each uploaded file, indicating whether it was accepted for processing, duplicated, or encountered an error during upload.

```json
[
  {
    "invoice_id": 1,
    "filename": "factura_nueva.pdf",
    "status": "processing",
    "message": "Invoice is being processed automatically"
  },
  {
    "invoice_id": null,
    "filename": "factura_repetida.pdf",
    "status": "duplicated",
    "message": "Invoice was already processed previously (detected by name)."
  },
  {
    "filename": "documento_invalido.txt",
    "status": "error",
    "message": "File type not allowed: text/plain. Allowed: application/pdf, image/jpeg, image/png"
  }
]
```

**Response (Error - 400 Bad Request):**
If no files are provided in the request.
```json
{
  "error": "No files found"
}
```

**Response (Error - 500 Internal Server Error):**
If there's an error saving records to the database during the initial processing stage.
```json
{
  "error": "An error occurred while processing some files in the database.",
  "details": [
    // List of results, some might show database errors
  ]
}
```

### 2. List Invoices

`GET /api/invoices/`

**Description:**
Retrieves a paginated list of invoices. Allows filtering by status, searching by filename, and sorting by various columns.

**Query Parameters:**
- `page` (integer, optional, default: 1): The page number to retrieve.
- `per_page` (integer, optional, default: 10, max: 100): Number of invoices per page.
- `status` (string, optional, multiple allowed): Filter by one or more invoice statuses (e.g., `status=processing&status=failed`). Valid statuses might include `processing`, `waiting_validation`, `processed`, `failed`, `rejected`, `duplicated`.
- `search` (string, optional): Search term to filter invoices by filename (case-insensitive).
- `sort_by` (string, optional, default: `created_at`): Column to sort by. Allowed columns are fields in the `Invoice` model (e.g., `id`, `filename`, `status`, `created_at`).
- `sort_order` (string, optional, default: `desc`): Sort order (`asc` or `desc`).

**Response (Success - 200 OK):**
Returns a paginated list of invoices matching the criteria.

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 10,
  "total": 53,
  "pages": 6,
  "invoices": [
    {
      "id": 15,

```json
{
  "error": "'page' and 'per_page' parameters must be integers."
}
```

**Response (Error - 500 Internal Server Error):**
If there's an error querying the database.
```json
{
  "error": "Error querying the database"
}
```

### 3. Get Invoice Details

`GET /api/invoices/<int:invoice_id>`

**Description:**
Retrieves detailed information for a specific invoice, including its current `status` reflecting the background processing stage, and extracted data (`preview_data` or `final_data`).

**Possible Statuses:**
- `processing`: The background task has started or is actively working on OCR/AI extraction.
- `waiting_validation`: The background task completed successfully. `preview_data` contains the extracted information, pending user confirmation via the `confirm` endpoint.
- `processed`: The invoice data has been confirmed (via the `confirm` endpoint) and moved to `final_data`. Processing is complete.
- `failed`: The background task encountered an error during processing. Check `InvoiceLog` (if available via another endpoint or logs) for details. Can be retried using the `retry` endpoint.
- `rejected`: The invoice was manually rejected via the `reject` endpoint. Can be retried using the `retry` endpoint.
- `duplicated`: The uploaded file was detected as a duplicate based on its filename during the initial upload.

**Path Parameters:**
- `invoice_id` (integer, required): The ID of the invoice to retrieve.

**Response (Success - 200 OK):**
```json
{
  "invoice_id": 15,
  "status": "processed",
  "final_data": {
    "invoice_number": "INV-001",
    "amount_total": 150.75,
    "date": "2024-07-20",
    "bill_to": "Client Corp",
    "currency": "USD",
    // ... other extracted fields
  },
  "preview_data": {
     // Potentially slightly different data if preview/final differ
     "invoice_number": "INV-001",
     "amount_total": 150.75,
     // ...
  }
}
```
*(Note: `preview_data` contains the data extracted by the background task (`process_invoice_task`). `final_data` holds the data after it has been explicitly confirmed via the `POST /confirm` endpoint. They might be identical if confirmation happens without changes).*

**Response (Error - 404 Not Found):**
If the invoice with the specified ID does not exist.
```json
{
  "error": "Invoice not found"
}
```

---

### 4. Confirm Invoice Data

`POST /api/invoices/<int:invoice_id>/confirm`

**Description:**
Confirms the data extracted by the background task for an invoice currently in the `waiting_validation` state. This copies the data from `preview_data` to `final_data` and updates the invoice status to `processed`.

**Path Parameters:**
- `invoice_id` (integer, required): The ID of the invoice to confirm.

**Response (Success - 200 OK):**
```json
{
  "invoice_id": 15,
  "status": "processed",
  "message": "Invoice confirmed and finalized successfully."
}
```

**Response (Error - 404 Not Found):**
If the invoice with the specified ID does not exist.
```json
{
  "error": "Invoice not found"
}
```

**Response (Error - 400 Bad Request):**
If the invoice has no `preview_data` to confirm.
```json
{
  "error": "No preview data to confirm"
}
```

---

### 5. Reject Invoice

`POST /api/invoices/<int:invoice_id>/reject`

**Description:**
Manually rejects an invoice, typically when it's in `waiting_validation`, `processing`, or `failed` state. This sets the status to `rejected`. Rejected invoices can be retried.

**Path Parameters:**
- `invoice_id` (integer, required): The ID of the invoice to reject.

**Request Body (optional):**
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
```json
{
  "reason": "Optional reason for rejection provided by the user."
}
```
If no reason is provided, a default message "Manual rejection by the user." is used.

**Response (Success - 200 OK):**
```json
{
  "invoice_id": 16,
  "status": "rejected",
  "message": "Invoice rejected successfully."
}
```

**Response (Error - 404 Not Found):**
If the invoice with the specified ID does not exist.
```json
{
  "error": "Invoice not found"
}
```

**Response (Error - 400 Bad Request):**
If the invoice is not in a state that allows rejection (e.g., already `processed` or `rejected`). The allowed statuses seem to be `waiting_validation`, `processing`, `failed`.
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot reject an invoice with status [current_status]"
}
```

---

### 6. Retry Invoice Processing

`POST /api/invoices/<int:invoice_id>/retry`

**Description:**
Requests a retry for an invoice that previously `failed` processing or was `rejected`. This sets the status back to `processing` and re-queues the `process_invoice_task` background job.

**Path Parameters:**
- `invoice_id` (integer, required): The ID of the invoice to retry.

**Response (Success - 202 Accepted):**
Indicates the retry request was accepted and processing will begin shortly.
```json
{
  "invoice_id": 17,
  "status": "processing",
  "message": "Invoice sent back for processing."
}
```

**Response (Error - 404 Not Found):**
If the invoice with the specified ID does not exist.
```json
{
  "error": "Invoice not found"
}
```

**Response (Error - 400 Bad Request):**
If the invoice is not in a state that allows retrying (only `failed` or `rejected` allowed).
```json
{
  "error": "Only failed or rejected invoices can be retried. Current status: [current_status]"
}
```

    "duplicated": 10
    // Only statuses with counts > 0 might be included
  }
}
```

---

### 9. Get Processed Invoice Data

`GET /api/invoices/data`

**Description:**
Retrieves detailed, structured data specifically from invoices that have been fully processed (status `processed`, data stored in `InvoiceData` model). Allows pagination and filtering by `op_number` found within the invoice items.

**Query Parameters:**
- `page` (integer, optional, default: 1): The page number to retrieve.
- `per_page` (integer, optional, default: 10): Number of processed invoice data entries per page.

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 10,
  "total": 25, // Total matching the op_number filter if applied
  "invoices": [
    {
      "invoice_id": 15,
      "invoice_number": "FINV-2024-001",
      "amount_total": 1500.50,
      "date": "2024-07-15",

      "payment_terms": "NET 30",
      "advertising_numbers": [ // Unique list aggregated from items
        "OP123",
        "OP456"
      ],
      "items": [
        {
          "description": "Service X",
          "amount": 1000.00,
          "advertising_numbers": ["OP123"]
        },
        {
          "description": "Service Y",
          "amount": 500.50,
          "advertising_numbers": ["OP456"]
        }
      ]
    }
    // ... more processed invoice data entries
  ]
}
```
*(Note: The `total` in the response reflects the count after filtering, if `op_number` is used).*

## 📡 Real-time Updates via WebSockets

The API utilizes WebSockets (likely via Flask-SocketIO) to push real-time status updates for invoices as they are processed by the background task.

**Namespace:** `/invoices`

**Event:** `invoice_status_update`

**Description:**
This event is emitted whenever the status of an invoice changes during its lifecycle (e.g., when processing starts, finishes successfully, fails, or is manually confirmed/rejected).

**Data Payload:**
The data sent with the event provides the current state of the invoice:
```json
{
  "id": <integer>,         // The ID of the invoice that was updated
  "status": "<string>",    // The new status of the invoice (e.g., "processing", "waiting_validation", "processed", "failed", "rejected")
  "filename": "<string>"   // The filename of the invoice
}
```

**Example Usage (Conceptual JavaScript):**
```javascript
// Assumes socket.io client library is included
const socket = io('/invoices'); // Connect to the namespace

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket namespace /invoices');
});

socket.on('invoice_status_update', (data) => {
  console.log('Invoice Status Update Received:', data);
  // Update your UI based on data.id and data.status
  // e.g., update status display for invoice with ID data.id
  //       to show the new status data.status
});

socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from WebSocket');
});
```

This allows clients to reflect the progress and final state of invoice processing without needing to continuously poll the API endpoints.
